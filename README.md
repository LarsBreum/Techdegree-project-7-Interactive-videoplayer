# Techdegree-project-7-Interactive-video-player
In this project I was tasked with creating an interactive video player using the mediaelement.js plugin.

The video player had the following expectations:
Play/pause funcionality
Fullscreen
Volume controls and progress bar

The video player had to have an interactive transcript which was provided by Treehouse aswell. The transcript had the following expectations:
Appropriate markup
Transcript highlights as video plays
The video skips to the proper place in the video when the trascript is clicked.

The site had to have a mobile first responsive design approach.

The mediaplayer had to have been styled by me.

I wrote the JavaScript as vanilla. The project could probably easily be replicated using jQuery, as the files are already included.
