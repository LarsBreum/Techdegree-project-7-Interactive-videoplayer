				Now that we've looked at the architecture

			</p>
			<p>
				2
				00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,535
				connect your personal devices to
				the internet inside your house.
			</p>
			<p>
				3
				00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:11,270
				Well there are many ways to

			</p>
			<p>
				4
				00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,960
				most often people connect wirelessly.
			</p>
			<p>
				5
				00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,940
				Let's look at an example of how

			</p>
			<p>

				00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,370
				If you live in a city or a town,

				00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,880
				cable Internet, or a phone line if you

			</p>
			<p>
				8
				00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,920
				your house, that connects you to
				the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.
			</p>
			<p>
				9
				00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,730
				If you live far out in the country,
				you'll more likely have
			</p>
			<p>
				10
				00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,430
				a dish outside your house, connecting
				you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or
			</p>
			<p>
				11
				00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,190
				you might also use the telephone system.

				Whether a wire comes straight from

			<p>
				14
				00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,760

				inside your house, is at your modem.
			</p>
			<p>
				15
				00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,780
